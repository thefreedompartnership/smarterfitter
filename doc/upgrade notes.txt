Went through and updated the config/ directory files by taking content from a newly generated blank application.

Altered config to use UTC
Altered routes to use map.root

# yeah, this sucks and needs to be reworked asap to get over to the cookie store
config.action_controller.session_store = :p_store

updated application.rb with the defaults that were listed in a new default version of teh file
add a secret because we're not using cookies

Outstanding questions:

. what's happening with sessions now, are they stored in the database, in the filesystem or in the cookie?
	- cookies now seem to be stored on the client... that's a good thing in some ways

. does the chain still work if we ditch out the cookies?
	- don't know

. should i get rid of the user and chains in the session?
	- yes, soon
	
. other upgrades to think about
	. renaming view files
	. split out environment.rb
	. paginating
	. any other plugins
	. freezing rails
